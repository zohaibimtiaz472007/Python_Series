🚀 100 Python Projects Series

Welcome to the 100 Python Projects Series — a complete, step‑by‑step journey from Python beginner to advanced developer. This repository is designed to help you learn Python by building real projects, not just reading theory.

Whether you're a student, self‑taught developer, or automation enthusiast, this series will strengthen your logic, problem‑solving skills, and real‑world coding experience.

📌 Why This Repository?

Most people learn Python syntax… but struggle to build real applications.

This series solves that problem by:

✅ Teaching Python through hands‑on projects

✅ Covering beginner → intermediate → advanced concepts

✅ Focusing on real‑world use cases

✅ Writing clean, understandable, and practical code

Each project is small, focused, and designed to teach one or more important Python concepts.
